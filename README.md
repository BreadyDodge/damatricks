# damatricks
A web application built to aid kendama competitions (or your practice sessions if you're not a Gallagher).

## features
- Randomized tricklist with no replacements (say goodbye to random number generators)
- Scoreboard (so judges won't forget your scores)
- Loads of tricklist (SKO, NAKO, BATB, KWC, etc)

## how can I contribute?
- You can help me get more trickslists from past competitions
- You can also request a feature you would like (here on github or shoot me a dm)
- yeah
